When creating a unit, there is a process:
    Refer to JSON data
    Apply any modifiers (weapon, armor, accessory, bonus)
    Then recalculate totalHp, totalDmg, etc... since totals begin at 0
    There may be some attributes that can be added when the unit is created:
        Units Killed: This is a per session stat
        Bonus stats: 
            Why declare these in the object itself? Isn't that just a lot of extra writing, in the JSON file? 
            Couldn't you just add these key:value pairs at the time the unit is created?
            Would this break any functions that are part of these objects by having references to stats that didn't exist at one time?
            Or do I add those functions to the constructor, the same one that'll add in those key:value pairs?
