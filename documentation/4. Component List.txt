List of every component, but how much do we break this down?

Main Menu (card)
    Top row
        Player Icon
        Subrow 1
            Name
            Gold indicator
        Subrow 2
            Rank Label
            Rank number
    Bottom row
        Subrow 1
            Button 1
                img
                label (shop)
            Button 2
                img
                label (quest)
            Button 3
                img
                label (rankings)
        Subrow 2
            Button 4
                label (inventor)
            Button 5
                img
                label (bestiary)
            Button 6
                img
                label (classes)

Is main menu a component?
    What about top row?
        Subrow?

We don't want to repeat the overlapping parts of this code. Inventory has buttons, too. Subrow 1 looks a lot like the header row of an item/enemy/class card. This suggests I build the most modular pieces as components. Basically, anything that can be used as a block. Then, larger components (like a card) are built by pulling in smaller components to make blueprints.

Ex: An enemy card would be built like this:

CARD(component)

(Top/header row)
Name    bestiary #         reward
DRAGON  72/100             (?G 35)

(Quick stats row)
(?HP:30)      (?Skill: Fire Breath)
(?Atk:6)      (?Type: Dragon)

(Description row)
Description:
Dragons blahblahblah blah blah blah
Dragons blahblahblah blah blah blah
Dragons blahblahblah blah blah blah
Dragons blahblahblah blah blah blah

Are the Stat:Value combos a component, or explicitly stated?

What is a card? Is it any popup? Items/classes/monsters all have the same layout, yet inventory, the upgrade prompt, mission choice, and bestiary have their own joint layout. Are they all cards? or are those two different sub-card types?
